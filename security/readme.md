# What is Limitless XDR?

## Visibility, Analytics, Response
While EDR is more readily implemented into a security team's existing toolset, XDR is far more effective at boosting teams' ability to monitor, detect, and respond across the organization's full attack surface. Wondering which solution is best for your organization's needs? Why not both? With Elastic Security's Limitless XDR, EDR is a key component — alongside SIEM and cloud security — of the comprehensive solution.

## EDR: malware, ransomware protection
**Malware Prevention** is ML based and evaluates the binary when it sees it. Signatureless malware prevention puts an immediate stop to malicious executables on endpoints. In its latest round of testing, AV-Comparatives found that the [Elastic Security machine learning model stops 99.6% of malware and triggers zero false positives on common business software](https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/business-security-test-2020-march-june/). 

**Behavioral ransomware** prevention detects and stops ransomware attacks on Windows systems by analyzing data from low-level system processes. It is effective across an array of widespread ransomware families — including those targeting the system’s master boot record.

## Detections
Rules run periodically and search for source events, matches, sequences, or machine learning job anomaly results that meet their criteria. When a rule’s criteria are met, a detection alert is created.
Enable Elastic prebuilt rules to immediately start detecting suspicious activity  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-rules.html 

Check our Github Repository: Elastic Security will develop rules in the open alongside the community, and we’re welcoming your community-driven detections https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules 
Create your own rules based on EQL, ML, IOC, Threahold with a simple wizard https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html
